## Us_ Insurance Price prediction

In this repository we'll be dealing Us insurance price prediction project we'll go through the process of creating a machine learning algorightme to predict the price of the insurance based on the  customer profile.
We'll use Python and the scikit-learn library to create a model that  can predict the price of the insurance based on the training data.

## Context
This dataset is from kaggle, and it contains the following features:

* **Age**: Customer age of primary beneficiary

* **Gender**: insurance contractor gender, female, male

* **BMI**: Body mass index, providing an understanding of body, weights that are relatively high or low relative to height, objective index of body weight (kg / m ^ 2) using the ratio of height to weight, ideally 18.5 to 24.9

* **Children**: Number of children covered by health insurance / Number of dependents

* **Smoker**: If the customer Smoking or not

* **Region**: The beneficiary's residential area in the US, northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest

  ## Python Libraries

  The following python libraries was us in this project

  For this lab, we will be using the following libraries:

-   `pandas` for managing the data.
-   `numpy` for mathematical operations.
-  `seaborn` for visualizing the data.
-   `matplotlib` for visualizing the data.
-   `sklearn` for machine learning and machine-learning-pipeline related functions.
